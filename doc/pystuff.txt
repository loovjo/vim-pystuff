TOOLS                                                         *pystuff-tools*

PEP                                                           *pystuff-pep*

By doing `<leader>pp` pystuff will bring up a window to the right containing the
output of the `pep`command. This will only work if the filetype of the current
file is set to `python`.

If you put the cursor on line and press `<C-J>`, the cursor will jump to the
respective file on that place.

There is no syntax highlighting in this mode

OUTLINE                                                       *pystuff-outline*

The outline is similar to the Pep (|pystuff-pep|), but instead of showing a
Pep, it shows an outline of the file. To start the outline, do `<leader>pp`

Say the file you are editing looks like this: >
    def f(x):
        a = 5
        b = -2
        k = x * 2
        return a + b - k
    y = f(3)
<This file would have an outline that looks like this: >
    2: def f(x)
      3: * a
      4: * b
      5: * k
    7: * y
<As you can see, all variable declarations have an asteriks before them, and
all variables in functions are indented appropriately. Classes and functions
in functions also work: >
    class Dummy:
        def __init__(self, a, b, c):
            self.a = a
            self.val = b + c
            self.var = b * c
        def get_val(self):
            return self.val
        def set_val(self, var):
            self.var = var
        def add_one_to_var(self):
            def add_one():
                self.var += 1
            return add_one
<The outline would look like this: >
    1: class Dummy
      2: def __init__(self, a, b, c)
          3: * self.a
          4: * self.val
          5: * self.var
      6: def get_val(self)
      8: def set_val(self, var)
          9: * self.var
      10: def add_one_to_var(self)
          11: def add_one()
<
